  header="What is Content Projection?"
  content="Content projection is a pattern in Angular that allows a component to accept and render markup provided by its parent. Using ng-content, a component declares projection slots where external content is inserted at runtime."

<app-expander
  header="Creating Customizable Components"
  content="Instead of relying on inputs for every visual variation, a component can expose projection slots that let consumers inject their own templates, icons, or layouts. This makes components truly open for extension while remaining closed for modification."

<app-expander
  header="Composite Components"
  content="Composite components combine multiple smaller, focused components into a cohesive whole. Each sub-component handles a single concern and communicates through well-defined interfaces, letting consumers mix and match building blocks."
