    What is Content Projection?</span
  >
  <h2>The Core Idea</h2>
  <p>
    Content projection is a pattern in Angular that allows a component to
    <strong>accept and render markup provided by its parent</strong>. Rather than hardcoding its
    inner structure, a component defines <strong>slots</strong>
    where external content is inserted at runtime.
  </p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    Using the <strong>ng-content</strong> element, a component declares one or more projection
    slots. The parent then passes arbitrary HTML or even other components into those slots, keeping
    the child component <strong>flexible, reusable, and decoupled</strong> from the content it
    displays.

    Creating Customizable Components</span
  >
  <h2>Beyond Inputs</h2>
  <p>
    Instead of relying on <strong>inputs for every visual variation</strong>, a component can expose
    projection slots that let consumers inject their own templates, icons, or layouts. This keeps
    the <strong>component API clean</strong> while offering unlimited flexibility.
  </p>

  <h2>Real-World Benefits</h2>
  <p>
    Buttons with custom icons, cards with rich headers, dialogs with dynamic footers — all become
    possible without touching the component's internal code. Content projection makes components
    <strong>truly open for extension</strong> while remaining closed for modification.

    Composite Components</span
  >
  <h2>Composition Over Configuration</h2>
  <p>
    Composite components take reusability further by
    <strong>combining multiple smaller, focused components</strong> into a cohesive whole. Each
    sub-component handles a single concern and communicates through
    <strong>well-defined interfaces</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Building Blocks</h2>
  <p>
    Think of a data table built from separate column, header, and row components, or a form layout
    assembled from field wrappers and validation indicators. This pattern lets consumers
    <strong>mix and match building blocks</strong> to create highly customizable UIs without
    modifying internal component code.
