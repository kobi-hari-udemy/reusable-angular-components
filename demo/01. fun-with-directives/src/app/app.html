  <h1>Understanding Angular Directives</h1>

  <p>
    Angular directives are powerful tools that allow you to extend HTML with custom behavior and
    transform the DOM in meaningful ways. They are one of the core building blocks of Angular
    applications and enable developers to create dynamic, interactive user interfaces.

    In this course, we will explore the fundamentals of Angular directives and learn how to 
    build powerful, reusable behaviors for your applications. Here's what we'll cover:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>How to create custom directives from scratch</li>
    <li highlight="yellow" (highlightDeactivated)="onDeactivation($event)">How to manipulate the host element in different ways</li>
    <li>How to add inputs and outputs to directives</li>
    <li underline highlight="cyan">How to work with selectors to target specific elements</li>
    <li>How to respond to events within directives</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 decorate="orange">Creating Custom Directives</h2>

  <p [highlight]="myColor()">
    While Angular provides many built-in directives, you can also create your own custom directives
    to encapsulate reusable behavior. Custom directives are decorated with the <code>@Directive</code> decorator
    and can access the host element through dependency injection.
  </p>

  <p>
    By mastering directives, you gain the ability to write cleaner, more maintainable code and
    create powerful abstractions that can be shared across your entire application.
